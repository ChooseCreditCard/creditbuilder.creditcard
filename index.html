  <!-- What is a credit builder card -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What is a credit builder card?</h2>
    <p class="small">
      A credit builder card is a product specifically designed for people with:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• No credit history</li>
      <li>• A thin file (very limited history)</li>
      <li>• Previous payment issues or defaults</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      The goal is not luxury perks – it’s to create a clean track record that future lenders can trust.

  <!-- Types of builder products -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Types of credit builder products</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Secured credit cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          You pay a cash deposit that becomes your credit limit. Low risk for the bank, high value for rebuilding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Low-limit unsecured cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          No deposit, but low limits and strict rules. Easier approval than premium products.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Credit builder loans</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Small loan that sits in a locked account while you “repay” it, then you get the money at the end.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Hybrid / subscription models</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Some fintechs mix subscriptions, reporting and virtual cards to help build history.

  <!-- How issuers evaluate progress -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>How issuers track your progress</h2>
    <p class="small">
      For most credit builder products, issuers monitor:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• On-time payment history (no missed due dates)</li>
      <li>• Utilization (how much of your limit you use)</li>
      <li>• Length of time you’ve held the card</li>
      <li>• Any other active debts or collections</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Practical tips -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Practical tips for building credit</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Set up automatic payments for at least the minimum</li>
      <li>• Aim to use less than 30% of your available limit</li>
      <li>• Keep the card open even if you rarely use it</li>
      <li>• Avoid applying for too many new products at once</li>
    </ul>
