    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit-Builder Card?</h2>
      <p>A credit-builder card is a credit card structured to help you <strong>build or rebuild</strong> a credit history. Limits are often low, fees are kept simple, and the issuer focuses on reporting your behaviour to credit bureaus rather than offering premium perks.</p>
      <p>Some products are technically “secured” cards backed by a deposit, while others are unsecured but targeted at people with limited credit. In both cases, the main goal is the same: create a pattern of responsible use that gradually improves your profile.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Credit-Builder Cards Typically Work</h2>
      <p>Many credit-builder cards start with a small limit – for example a few hundred in your local currency. If the card is secured, you place a refundable deposit; if unsecured, the issuer relies on tighter limits and risk controls instead.</p>
      <p>Each month, your balance, minimum payment and any late payments are reported to credit bureaus where applicable. Over time, <strong>on-time payments and low utilization</strong> can improve your credit status, while missed payments can still harm it.</p>

            <tr>
              <th>Feature</th>
              <th>What to Expect</th>

              <td>Helps control risk and encourages modest usage.</td>

              <td>Deposit (secured)</td>

    <!-- Habits & risks -->
    <section id="habits" class="section">
      <h2>Habits That Actually Build Credit</h2>
      <p>Having a credit-builder card is not enough on its own – what matters is how you use it. Issuers and bureaus tend to focus on a few core signals when assessing your behaviour.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pay on time, every time:</strong> Even one late payment can hurt a rebuilding profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep utilization low:</strong> Many guides suggest staying well below 30% of your limit if you can.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid maxing out:</strong> Frequently hitting your limit can be seen as a sign of stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Let history build:</strong> Keeping an account open and in good standing over time can help your track record.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It can be tempting to use the full limit when cash is tight, but from a credit-building perspective, <strong>consistency and moderation</strong> are usually more important than using every available unit of credit.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risks, Fees and When to Be Careful</h2>
      <p>Credit-builder products are tools, not magic fixes. Some come with higher APRs, penalty fees or other charges that can quickly add up if you carry a balance.</p>
      <p>Before you apply, always review:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Annual fees, monthly fees or maintenance charges.</li>
        <li>APR on purchases, cash withdrawals and balance transfers (if offered).</li>
        <li>Any “set-up” or “program” fees that reduce the usable limit.</li>
        <li>Whether and where the card reports to credit bureaus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your situation is complex or you are already struggling with bills, consider speaking with a non-profit debt counsellor or other independent adviser before adding more credit products.</p>
