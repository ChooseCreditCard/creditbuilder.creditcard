    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit-Builder Card?</h2>
      <p>Credit-builder cards are designed for people with little or poor credit history. Typically, they come with low limits or require a refundable security deposit to reduce issuer risk and improve chances of approval.</p>
      <p>These cards function like normal credit cards — allowing you to spend, pay, and build a history of on-time payments, which lenders observe when evaluating your creditworthiness over time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Secured and Starter Cards Work</h2>
      <p>With a secured card, you deposit a sum of money that becomes or backs your credit line. If you default, the issuer can use the deposit to cover losses. This lowers risk for issuers and allows approval even with limited credit history.</p>
      <p>Starter unsecured cards may offer small credit limits. Issuers monitor how you manage the card — usage, timely payments and credit utilisation — to decide if you qualify for limit increases or standard cards later on.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Strategy -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Smart Strategy to Build Credit Responsibly</h2>
      <p>Use the card regularly for small, predictable expenses (e.g. utilities, subscriptions, groceries). Always pay the full balance on time and avoid carrying debt. Keep credit utilisation low — ideally under 30% of your limit — to signal reliability.</p>
      <p>Avoid applying for many cards at once; instead, stay consistent with one or two. Gradually request limit increases or upgrades as your payment history builds, which enhances your credit profile over time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Comparison & Considerations -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What to Consider Before Choosing a Credit-Builder Card</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Deposit amount vs. credit limit — ensure the card remains affordable even if deposit is required.</li>
        <li>Fees and interest — some cards have higher fees or APRs; always aim to pay off balance in full monthly.</li>
        <li>Reporting — check that the issuer reports to major credit bureaus to ensure your history is recorded.</li>
        <li>Upgrade path — see if the card allows transitioning to a standard credit card once qualified.</li>
        <li>Your spending habits — a card only helps if used periodically and managed responsibly.</li>
      </ul>
